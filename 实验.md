## Munin 
Munin is a networked resource monitoring tool that can help analyze resource trends and "what just happened to kill our performance?" problems. It is designed to be very plug and play. A default installation provides a lot of graphs with almost no work.

## ntopng
ntopng is the next generation version of the original ntop, a network traffic probe that monitors network usage. ntopng is based on libpcap and it has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform, MacOSX and on Windows as well.

ntopng – yes, it’s all lowercase – provides a intuitive, encrypted web user interface for the exploration of realtime and historical traffic information.
Main Features

    Sort network traffic according to many criteria including IP address, port, L7 protocol, throughput, Autonomous Systems (ASs)
    Show realtime network traffic and active hosts
    Produce long-term reports for several network metrics including throughput and application protocols
    Top talkers (senders/receivers), top ASs, top L7 applications
    Monitor and report live throughput, network and application latencies, Round Trip Time (RTT), TCP statistics (retransmissions, out of order packets, packet lost), and bytes and packets transmitted
    Store on disk persistent traffic statistics to allow future explorations and post-mortem analyses
    Geolocate and overlay hosts in a geographical map
    Discover application protocols (Facebook, YouTube, BitTorrent, etc) by leveraging on nDPI, ntop Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology
    Characterise HTTP traffic by leveraging on characterisation services provided by Google and HTTP Blacklist.
    Analyse IP traffic and sort it according to the source/destination.
    Report IP protocol usage sorted by protocol type
    Produce HTML5/AJAX network traffic statistics.
    Full support for IPv4 and IPv6
    Full Layer-2 support (including ARP statistics)
    GTP/GRE detunnelling
    Support for MySQL, ElasticSearch and LogStash export of monitored data
    Interactive historical exploration of monitored data exported to MySQL
    Alerts engine to capture anomalous and suspicious hosts
    SNMP v1/v2c support and continuous monitoring of SNMP devices

## MRTG
Tobi Oetiker's MRTG - The Multi Router Traffic Grapher
What it does

You have a router, you want to know what it does all day long? Then MRTG is for you. It will monitor SNMP network devices and draw pretty pictures showing how much traffic has passed through each interface.

Routers are only the beginning. MRTG is being used to graph all sorts of network devices as well as everything else from weather data to vending machines.

MRTG is written in perl and works on Unix/Linux as well as Windows and even Netware systems. MRTG is free software licensed under the Gnu GPL.

## Net-SNMP
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment (eg. routers), computer equipment and even devices like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMP v1, SNMP v2c and SNMP v3 using both IPv4 and IPv6. The suite includes:

    Command-line applications to:
        retrieve information from an SNMP-capable device, either using single requests (snmpget, snmpgetnext), or multiple requests (snmpwalk, snmptable, snmpdelta).
        manipulate configuration information on an SNMP-capable device (snmpset).
        retrieve a fixed collection of information from an SNMP-capable device (snmpdf, snmpnetstat, snmpstatus).
        convert between numerical and textual forms of MIB OIDs, and display MIB content and structure (snmptranslate).
    A graphical MIB browser (tkmib), using Tk/perl.
    A daemon application for receiving SNMP notifications (snmptrapd). Selected notifications can be logged (to syslog, the NT Event Log, or a plain text file), forwarded to another SNMP management system, or passed to an external application.
    An extensible agent for responding to SNMP queries for management information (snmpd). This includes built-in support for a wide range of MIB information modules, and can be extended using dynamically loaded modules, external scripts and commands, and both the SNMP multiplexing (SMUX) and Agent Extensibility (AgentX) protocols.
    A library for developing new SNMP applications, with both C and perl APIs.

## Verax SNMP Agent Simulator
Verax SNMP Agent Simulator enables simulation of multiple SNMP v1/v2c agents on a single host. It allows saving money by rapid building of simulated networks without purchasing additional hardware. Each agent runs on the standard SNMP 161 port, with a different IP address assigned via multi-netting. Agents’ responses can be loaded from bundled configuration files or collected from real devices using SNMP-walk, and can be modified at runtime by user-defined rules.
